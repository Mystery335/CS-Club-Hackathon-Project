            <p>Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her,
                but most of all her grandmother. The grandmother gifted her a little cap made of red velvet and
                she never stopped wearing it since then, and from then on, she is always called Little Red Riding Hood.
                One day, her mother told her to bring a cake and a bottle of wine to her grandmother and said that
                it is good for her grandmother. Her mother told her what she should not do and what she
                should do before she left. Her grandmother lived deep in the forest and on her way there she encountered a wolf.
